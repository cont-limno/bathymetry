  abstract = {Sediment focusing is a process whereby water turbulence moves sedimented material from shallower to deeper zones of a lake. Sediment focusing occurs in lakes in both the erosional (coarse-grained sediments) and the transportational zone with the latter characterized by discontinuous sedimentation and resuspension. The zone of accumulation is diefined as the zone where sedimentation is final (i.e. no resuspension) and where there is no further sediment focusing. A geochemical tracer (Pb) was used to trace sediment focusing patterns in 12 lakes of different morphomctries. The area occupied by the zone of accumulation is predicted from the mean basin slope (a',) with 86\% of the variance explained. Only in large, exposed lakes in which turbulence from waves is more severe are the resulting sediment distributions more erratic. This study is the first to provide a general model of sc:diment focusing patterns among lakes.},

Their influence should be taken into account in the numerical weather prediction (NWP) and climate models through parameterisation. For parameterisation, data on lake characteristics external to the model are also needed. The most important parameter is the lake depth. Global database of lake depth GLDB (Global Lake Database) is developed to parameterise lakes in NWP and climate modelling. The main purpose of the study is to upgrade GLDB by use of indirect estimates of the mean depth for lakes in boreal zone, depending on their geological origin. For this, Tectonic Plates Map, geological, geomorphologic maps and the map of Quaternary deposits were used. Data from maps were processed by an innovative algorithm, resulting in 141 geological regions where lakes were considered to be of kindred origin. To obtain a typical mean lake depth for each of the selected regions, statistics from GLDB were gained and analysed. The main result of the study is a new version of GLDB with estimations of the typical mean lake depth included. Potential users of the product are NWP and climate models.},

  abstract = {Volume measurements are essential for a wide variety of lake and reservoir applications, with recent technological and computational advances greatly improving volume estimate accuracy. Triangulated irregular network bathymetric models, created with spatially referenced depth data, are now commonly available for computer processing. Large datasets can easily be handled in geographic information system software, but field data acquisition is the principal time investment; therefore, determining minimum data density requirements associated with accurate volume estimates has great practical and economic relevance. We used spatially referenced hydroacoustic depth data acquired along parallel transects to assess survey resolution required to obtain accurate volume measures on 5 northeastern Washington lakes and reservoirs. Volume estimates decreased in each study waterbody as sampling resolution decreased, exhibited by significant (P {$<$} 0.0001) monotonic decreasing functions. Our study showed that hydroacoustic surveys with 50 m transect spacing were 99.0\textendash 99.6\% (95\% confidence interval, 98.3\textendash 100.5\%) accurate compared to modeled volume. Across all study sites, volume estimates based on 300 m spaced transect surveys averaged 4.2 and 9.6\% lower, with and without near-shore transects, respectively, when compared to 50 m spaced transect surveys. The addition of a near-shore transect increased the accuracy of volume estimates at large transect spacings, especially when large near-shore changes in depth were missed. As expected, higher sampling resolution increased volume estimate accuracy; however, our results suggest that survey effort should focus on topographically complex areas, such as near-shore areas, when time and/or economic constraints limit the acquisition of data.},

  abstract = {Topography is critical information for water resources management in lakes, and remote sensing provides a unique opportunity to estimate topography in ungauged regions. We introduce here a new method that estimates nearshore topography of water bodies based on a flood frequency map and time series of water levels by assuming the equivalence between flood frequency and water level exceedance probability at a given area. Test cases are performed for two lakes and 12 hydropower reservoirs using the proposed Flood2Topo app. This new application generates the bottom level pixel by pixel and level-area-active storage relationship directly from the topography map, without the need to fit functions. Flood extent estimates from the Landsat based Global Surface Water (GSW) data set, the current state-of-the-art, were used to run Flood2Topo, together with water levels from satellite altimetry and in situ gauges. Results show bottom level root mean square deviation (RMSD) values of 18.5 and 146 cm for Lake Poop\'o (Bolivia) and Lake Curuai (Amazon basin), respectively. For reservoir active storage, RMSD normalized values ranged from 2\% to 11\% for 11 reservoirs (average NRMSD of 6.4\%). The method can be applied to any seasonally flooded area using any data set. Considering the surface water occurrence map from the GSW data set, the method is applicable to 35.8\% (86\%) of the global seasonally flooded areas delimited by flood frequencies between 0 and 95\% (99\%) over 35 years. The flood frequency-based method is a promising tool for obtaining data for hydrodynamic simulations and monitoring of ungauged water bodies.},

Volume differences derived from multiple surveys of individual reservoirs also provide estimates of capacity loss over time due to sedimentation. Completing each survey requires extensive field data collection and precise data analysis, which often limit the frequency with which surveys may be conducted.

In this study, we use a hydrological model coupled with a lake/wetland algorithm to simulate the effects of lake bathymetry, human water use, and decadal climate variability on the lake's level, surface area, and water storage. In addition to the effects of persistent droughts and increasing irrigation withdrawals on the shrinking, we find that the lake's unique bathymetry\textemdash which allows its division into two smaller lakes\textemdash has made it more vulnerable to water loss. Unfortunately the lake's split is favored by the 1952\textendash 2006 climatology. Failure of the lake to remerge with renewed rainfall in the 1990s following the drought years of the 1970s and 1980s is a consequence of irrigation withdrawals. Under current climate and water use, a full recovery of the lake is unlikely without an inter-basin water transfer. Breaching the barrier separating the north and south lakes would reduce the amount of supplemental water needed for recovery.},

  abstract = {We evaluate different techniques that rebuild reservoir bathymetry by combining multi-satellite imagery of surface water elevation and extent. Digital elevation models (DEMs) are processed in two distinct ways in order to determine 3-D reservoir bathymetry. They are defined as (a) linear extrapolation and (b) linear interpolation. The first one linearly extrapolates the land slope, defining the bottom as the intersection of all extrapolated lines. The second linearly interpolates the uppermost and lowermost pixels of the reservoir's main river, repeating the process for all other tributaries. A visible bathymetry, resulting from the combination of radar altimetry and water extent masks, can be coupled with the DEM, improving the accuracy of techniques (a) and (b). Envisatand Altika-based altimetric time series is combined to a Landsat-based water extent database over the 2002\textendash 2016 period in order to generate the visible bathymetry, and topography is derived from the 3-arcsec HydroSHEDS DEM. Fourteen 3-D bathymetries derived from the combination of these techniques and datasets, plus the inclusion of upstream and downstream riverbed elevations, are evaluated over Lake Mead. Accuracy is measured using ground observations, and show that metrics improve as a function of added data requirement and processing. Best bathymetry estimates are obtained when the visible bathymetry, linear extrapolation technique and riverbed elevation are combined. Water storage variability is also evaluated and shows that best results are derived from the aforementioned combination. This study contributes to our understanding and representation of reservoir water impoundment impacts on the hydrological cycle.},

  abstract = {Small topographic depressions have important functions in hydrology and ecology because they store water in the form of shallow lakes, wetlands or ephemeral ponds. The relations between the area A, the volume V, and the depth h of water in depressions are important for evaluating water and dissolved-mass balances of the system. The A\textendash h and V\textendash h relations are usually determined from fine-resolution elevation maps based on detailed survey data. Simple equations are presented in this paper, which can be used to: (1) interpolate A\textendash h and V\textendash h data points obtained by a detailed survey; (2) approximate unknown A\textendash h and V\textendash h relations of a depression from a minimal set of field data without a time-consuming elevation survey; and (3) serve as a geometric model of depressions in simulation studies. The equations are simple power functions having two constants. The first constant s is related to the size of the depression, and the second constant p is related to the geometry of the depression. The power functions adequately represent A\textendash h and V\textendash h relations of all 27 wetlands and ephemeral ponds examined in this paper, which are situated in the northern prairie region of North America. Assuming that the power functions are applicable for other similar topographic depressions, an observer only needs to measure A and h twice to determine the two constants in the equation. The equations will be useful in field studies requiring approximate A\textendash h and V\textendash h relations and in theoretical and modeling studies. ᭧ 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

In this work, two mathematical approaches to describe the shape of a lake basin are introduced and tested against empirical data. The two methods require only three easily available input parameters: maximum depth, surface area and volume. The first method is based on a traditional morphometric parameter, the volume development (Vd), and the second method on the new hypsographic development parameter (Hd). Both methods give area and volume at any depth of a lake and can furthermore be used to estimate lake bottom slopes. Comparisons with empirical area\textendash depth and volume\textendash depth distribution curves from 105 lakes that cover a wide range of lake morphometric characteristics have revealed that the two methods give very satisfactory results. The Vd-model yields r2-values of 0.924 and 0.907 for area and volume description with lake depth, respectively. The corresponding r2-values for the Hd-model are 0.988 and 0.996, respectively. Using the Hd-model, an approach has also been developed to test when and by how much it is necessary to correct the empirical volume of a lake given the number of measured strata and basin shape.},

Deep lakes and lakes with high average temperatures have experienced the largest changes in lake stratification even though their surface temperatures tend to be warming more slowly. These results confirm that the nonlinear relationship between water density and water temperature and the strong dependence of lake stratification on lake morphometry makes lake temperature trends relatively poor predictors of lake stratification trends.},

  abstract = {Knowledge of reservoir bathymetry is essential for many studies on terrestrial hydrological and biogeochemical processes. However, there are currently no cost-effective approaches to derive reservoir bathymetry at the global scale. This study explores the potential of generating high-resolution global bathymetry using elevation data collected by the 532-nm Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS) onboard the Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite (ICESat-2). The novel algorithm was developed and tested using the ICESat-2 airborne prototype, the Multiple Altimeter Beam Experimental Lidar (MABEL), with Landsat-based water classifications (from 1982 to 2017). MABEL photon elevations were paired with Landsat water occurrence percentiles to establish the elevation\textendash area (E\textendash A) relationship, which in turn was applied to the percentile image to obtain partial bathymetry over the historic dynamic range of reservoir area. The bathymetry for the central area was projected to achieve the full bathymetry. The bathymetry image was then embedded onto the digital elevation model (DEM). Results were validated over Lake Mead against survey data. Results over four transects show coefficient of determination (R2) values from 0.82 to 0.99 and root-mean-square error (RMSE) values from 1.18 to 2.36 m. In addition, the E\textendash A and elevation\textendash storage (E\textendash S) curves have RMSEs of 1.56 m and 0.08 km3, respectively. Over the entire dynamic reservoir area, the derived bathymetry agrees very well with independent survey data, except for within the highest and lowest percentile bands. With abundant overpassing tracks and high spatial resolution, the newly launched ICESat-2 should enable the derivation of bathymetry over an unprecedented number of reservoirs.},

However, simulating their impacts on regional-scale hydrology is still a major challenge and not widely attempted. In the present study, the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model is applied and evaluated with a physically based lake and wetland algorithm, which can simulate the effect of lakes and wetlands on the grid cell energy and water balance. The VIC model was calibrated at 10 U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) stream gauging stations against daily streamflow records for the period of 1985\textendash 95, and successfully evaluated for the period of 1996\textendash 2005. Single-grid sensitivity experiments showed that runoff, baseflow, and inundation area were sensitive to the lake model parameters. Simulations were also conducted to analyze the spatial and temporal variability of inundation area for the period of 1985\textendash 2005. Results indicated that water and energy fluxes were substantially affected when lakes and wetlands were included in model simulations. Domain-averaged annual mean evapotranspiration (ET) was increased by 5\% while annual mean total runoff was decreased by 12\% with lakes and wetlands. Latent heat flux increased while sensible heat flux decreased because of the inclusion of lakes and wetlands.},

  abstract = {For over a century, geomorphologists have attempted to unravel information about landscape evolution, and processes that drive it, using river profiles. Many studies have combined new topographic datasets with theoretical models of channel incision to infer erosion rates, identify rock types with different resistance to erosion, and detect potential regions of tectonic activity. The most common metric used to analyse river profile geometry is channel steepness, or ks. However, the calculation of channel steepness requires the normalisation of channel gradient by drainage area. This normalisation requires a power law exponent that is referred to as the channel concavity index. Despite the concavity index being crucial in determining channel steepness, it is challenging to constrain. In this contribution, we compare both slope\textendash area methods for calculating the concavity index and methods based on integrating drainage area along the length of the channel, using so-called ``chi'' ({$\chi$}) analysis. We present a new {$\chi$}-based method which directly compares {$\chi$} values of tributary nodes to those on the main stem; this method allows us to constrain the concavity index in transient landscapes without assuming a linear relationship between {$\chi$} and elevation. Patterns of the concavity index have been linked to the ratio of the area and slope exponents of the stream power incision model (m/n); we therefore construct simple numerical models obeying detachment-limited stream power and test the different methods against simulations with imposed m and n. We find that {$\chi$}-based methods are better than slope\textendash area methods at reproducing imposed m/n ratios when our numerical landscapes are subject to either transient uplift or spatially varying uplift and fluvial erodibility. We also test our methods on several real landscapes, including sites with both lithological and structural heterogeneity, to provide examples of the methods' performance and limitations. These methods are made available in a new software package so that other workers can explore how the concavity index varies across diverse landscapes, with the aim to improve our understanding of the physics behind bedrock channel incision.},

The hierarchical GAM (HGAM), allows modeling of nonlinear functional relationships between covariates and outcomes where the shape of the function itself varies between different grouping levels. We describe the theoretical connection between HGAMs, HGLMs, and GAMs, explain how to model different assumptions about the degree of intergroup variability in functional response, and show how HGAMs can be readily fitted using existing GAM software, the mgcv package in R. We also discuss computational and statistical issues with fitting these models, and demonstrate how to fit HGAMs on example data.

Machine learning leads to more efficient, user-friendly analytics as the streams of data increase while hypothesis-driven decisions lead to the strategic design of experiments to fill knowledge gaps and to elucidate mechanisms. KLAS will transform ecology and environmental sciences by shortening the time lag between individual discoveries and leaps in knowledge by the scientific community, and will lead to paradigm shifts predicated on open access data and analytics in a machine learning environment.},

  abstract = {Eutrophication mitigation is an ongoing priority for aquatic ecosystems. However, the current eutrophication control strategies (phosphorus (P) and/or nitrogen (N)) are guided mainly by nutrient addition experiments in small waters without encompassing all in-lake biogeochemical processes that are associated largely with lake morphological characteristics. Here, we use a global lake data set (573 lakes) to show that the relative roles of N vs P in affecting eutrophication are underpinned by water depth. Mean depth and maximum depth relative to mixing depth were used to distinguish shallow (mixing depth {$>$} maximum depth), deep (mixing depth {$<$} mean depth), and transitional (mean depth {$\leq$} mixing depth {$\leq$} maximum depth) lakes in this study. TN/TP ratio (by mass) was used as an indicator of potential lake nutrient limitation, i.e., N only limitation if N/P {$<$} 9, N + P colimitation if 9 {$\leq$} N/P {$<$} 22.6, and P only limitation if N/P {$\geq$} 22.6. The results show that eutrophication is favored in shallow lakes, frequently (66.2\%) with N limitation while P limitation predominated (94.4\%) in most lakes but especially in deep ones. The importance of N limitation increases but P limitation decreases with lake trophic status while N and P colimitation occurs primarily (59.4\%) in eutrophic lakes. These results demonstrate that phosphorus reduction can mitigate eutrophication in most large lakes but a dual N and P reduction may be needed in eutrophic lakes, especially in shallow ones (or bays). Our analysis helps clarify the long debate over whether N, P, or both control primary production. While these results imply that more resources be invested in nitrogen management, given the high costs of nitrogen pollution reduction, more comprehensive results from carefully designed experiments at different scales are needed to further verify this modification of the existing eutrophication mitigation paradigm.},

  abstract = {The European Water Framework Directive 2000 (WFD) stipulates that surface water bodies, such as lakes, should achieve good ecological and chemical status (pollutant levels) by 2015. However, the extant environmental monitoring programmes of most member states have major deficiencies in terms of the baseline data required, thus potentially jeopardising the compliance schedules of the WFD. Great Britain has over 40 000 lakes {$>$}1 ha, but bathymetric data are available for less than 2\%. This paper presents a collation of available bathymetric data (622 sites) and demonstrates the utility of morphometric analysis to bridge the gap between surveyed and un-surveyed systems. Type-specific relations between mean (Dmv) and maximum (Dmax) water depths were developed for natural lakes (r2 values ranging from 0.87 to 0.99), as well as modified systems and impoundments (r2 values ranging from 0.74 to 0.99). Stepwise regression was also undertaken to predict Dmv and Dmax using only map-derived information (such as lake area, catchment area and shoreline length). The results varied markedly between ``geological types'', with ``medium alkalinity'' (MA) lakes giving the highest coefficients of determination (R2 of 0.79 and 0.82, respectively). Predicting Dmv is important because it permits calculation of parameters such as the volume (V) (and hence residence time) and dynamic ratio (DR) which provides a measure of the likely extent of sediment re-suspension. This preliminary analysis has demonstrated the potential of the morphometric approach to generate valuable parameters from limited field investment and will provide a valuable stop-gap until the results of the WFD's comprehensive monitoring programmes are realized.},

Nevertheless, volume and depth data are scarce in lake-rich regions of the world.

Lake area and the maximum slope in a 50 m wide zone outside of the lake shoreline were the most important predictors of both lake volume and depth, explaining 92\% of the variance in lake volume but ˂40\% of the variance in both maximum and mean depth. Regression parameters of regional submodels of lake volume were similar across geographically and topographically different regions, indicating that the model probably is applicable for glacially formed lakes in general. Despite the high degree of explanation for lake volume, the uncertainty in predicted volume for a single lake is considerable (relative standard deviation, {$\pm$}57\%). However, the mean or cumulative lake volume of catchments containing several lakes (n {$>$} 15) is predictable from map-derived parameters with a greatly reduced uncertainty.},

This is the first step to improving our knowledge of riverine systems, both their morphology and role in ecosystems. The Experimental Advanced Airborne Research LiDAR B (EAARL-B) system is one such topobathymetric sensor, capable of mapping both terrestrial and aquatic systems. Whereas the original EAARL was developed to survey littoral areas, the new version, EAARL-B, was also designed for riverine systems but has yet to be tested. Thus, we evaluated the ability of EAARL-B to map bathymetry and floodplain topography at sub-meter resolution in a mid-size gravel-bed river. We coupled the EAARL-B survey with highly accurate field surveys (0.03 m vertical accuracy and approximately 0.6 by 0.6 m resolution) of three morphologically distinct reaches, approximately 200 m long 15 m wide, of the Lemhi River (Idaho, USA). Both point-to-point and raster-to-raster comparisons between ground and EAARL-B surveyed elevations show that differences (ground minus EAARL-B surveyed elevations) over the entire submerged topography are small (root mean square error, RMSE, and median absolute error, M, of 0.11 m), and large differences (RMSE, between 0.15 and 0.38 m and similar M) are mainly present in areas with abrupt elevation changes and covered by dense overhanging vegetation. RMSEs are as low as 0.03 m over paved smooth surfaces, 0.07 m in submerged, gradually varying topography, and as large as 0.24 m along banks with and without dense, tall vegetation. EAARL-B performance is chiefly limited by point density in areas with strong elevation gradients and by LiDAR footprint size (0.2 m) in areas with topographic features of similar size as the LiDAR footprint. \textcopyright{} 2018 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Reservoir storage-area-depth relationships are the most important factors controlling thermal stratification in reservoirs and, more broadly, the water, energy, and biogeochemical dynamics in the reservoirs and subsequently their impacts on downstream rivers. However, most land surface or Earth system models do not account for the gradual changes of reservoir surface area and storage with the changing depth, inhibiting a consistent and accurate representation of mass, energy, and biogeochemical balances in reservoirs. Here we present a physically coherent parameterization of reservoir storage-area-depth data set at the global scale. For each reservoir, the storage-area-depth relationships were derived from an optimal geometric shape selected iteratively from five possible regular geometric shapes that minimize the error of total storage and surface area estimation. We applied this algorithm to over 6,800 reservoirs included in the Global Reservoir and Dam database. The relative error between the estimated and observed total storage is no more than 5\% and 50\% for 66\% and 99\% of all Global Reservoir and Dam reservoirs, respectively. More importantly, the storage-depth profiles derived from the approximated reservoir geometry compared well with remote sensing based estimation at 40 major reservoirs from previous studies and ground-truth measurements for 34 reservoirs in the United States and China. The new global reservoir storage-area-depth data set is critical for advancing future modeling and understanding of reservoir processes and subsequent effects on the terrestrial hydrological, ecological, and biogeochemical cycles at the regional and global scales.},
