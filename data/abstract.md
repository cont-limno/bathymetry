The primary goal of this project was to test the utility of bathymetric data
for predicting lake depth. To this end, we gathered data on lake depth for approximately 5,000 lakes in the Northeastern and Midwestern US from nine state-level databases. We cleaned and interpolated this data to produce bathymetric raster surfaces and estimates of depth-area relationships (i.e. hypsographic curves) for each lake.
