## General Protocols

We used data on lake bathymetry for approximately 5,000 lakes in the Northeastern and Midwestern US from nine state-level databases. The original data came in a variety of formats including pre-interpolated rasters (Minnesota), contour lines (Nebraska, Michigan, Massachusetts, Kansas, Iowa), contour polygons (New Hampshire, Connecticut), or point depth soundings (Maine). For the Minnesota data, we simply clipped the raster for each lake to its outline. For data from remaining states, we processed each lake by converting its original representation to a point layer (if necessary), rasterizing these points, and creating an interpolated bathymetry surface using a simple moving window average in the raster R package (Hijmans 2019). The size of the moving window was adjusted iteratively to ensure that each bathymetry raster contained no missing data. All lake bathymetry was specifically calculated relative to NHD (USGS, 2019) waterbodies such that source data and bathymetry surface outputs were clipped to the area of each lake polygon. We restricted the lakes in our study to those with an area of at least 4 ha and a maximum depth of at least 0.3 m (1 ft). Normalized depth-area relationships (i.e. hypsographic curves) were calculated following the method of Hakanson (1977).
