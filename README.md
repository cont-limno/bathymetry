# Analysis of LAGOSNE depth data

Potential future analyses:

 * [ ] lake depth by glaciation status
 * [ ] lake depth by connectivity
 * [ ] lake depth by lake surface area (is there a piecewise relationship?)
 * [ ] Does an "elipitic sinusoid" predict lake depth?
 * [ ] Landform (mountains, prarie, etc.)
 * [ ] Elevation s.d.
 * [ ] Lakeshape (convexhull) versus depth
