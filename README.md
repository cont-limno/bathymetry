# LAGOSUS depth data

Contains data from:

 * Manual efforts (internet searching)
 
 * LAGOSNE (also internet searching)
 
 * National Lakes Assessments (NLA)

## Potential future analyses:

 * [ ] lake depth by glaciation status
 * [ ] lake depth by connectivity
 * [ ] lake depth by lake surface area (is there a piecewise relationship?)
 * [ ] Does an "elipitic sinusoid" predict lake depth?
 * [ ] Landform (mountains, prarie, etc.)
 * [ ] Elevation s.d.
 * [ ] Lakeshape (convexhull) versus depth
